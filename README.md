Selection Sort:
In the selection sort it list array by selecting smallest element in unsorted portion of arrary and exchanging it with element at the begining of the unsorted list.In Selection Sort it is a basic sorting algorithm that relies on comparisons. It functions by repeatedly choosing the smallest (or largest, based on the order of sorting) element from the list's unsorted section and shifting it to the start (or finish) of the sorted section.

1.Initialization: The subarray up to index I, which is initially empty, is regarded as sorted before the algorithm begins sorting. This is only true.

2.Maintenance: The algorithm finds the smallest element in the array's unsorted section and moves it to the appropriate location at index i as it goes through each iteration. The subarray from beginning to i is sorted and contains the smallest elements of the original array; this property is maintained after each iteration as the sorted area of the array grows by one element.

3.Termination: The array has been processed through the last iteration of the algorithm, and the invariant ensures that every element has been sorted in ascending order.

4.So the Selection Sort is accurat
